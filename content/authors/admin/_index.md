Dr. Vasiliki (Vicky) Bikia is a Bioengineering postdoctoral research fellow at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, in the Laboratory of Hemodynamics and Cardiovascular Technology. Her research aims to build and deliver clinical and digital tools that enable the non-invasive assessment of cardiovascular health using machine learning.

Dr. Bikia is leading a clinical study to evaluate the performance of a new non-invasive method to monitor major central hemodynamics, such as aortic blood pressure and flow.

She is a member of the Stanford Byers Center for Biodesign CardinalKit team with the goal of contributing to the design and improvement of data pipelining as well as performing data analysis in several CardinalKit-based research projects at Stanford.
